# TensorFlow Learning Challenge: Daily Progress

This repository is a collection of notebooks and code files that capture my daily progress as I dive deeper into TensorFlow through various courses and practical projects. My goal is to consistently practice, experiment, and grow my skills in machine learning and deep learning using TensorFlow.

### Why This Repository Exists
This challenge is designed to:
- Track my growth and progress.
- Provide a central location for all my TensorFlow learnings.
- Showcase various topics from beginner to advanced TensorFlow concepts.
- Enable others to learn alongside me and give feedback.

### Key Highlights
- **Daily Commitment**: I aim to push new content daily based on what I learn.
- **Projects**: Alongside basic learning, there will be small projects demonstrating applications of TensorFlow

### How to Use This Repository
1. **Link to Colab**: Each notebook has link to collab in it.
2. **Explore the Notebooks**: Explore the codes in Each File.
3. **Run the Code**: You can run the notebooks locally or on any Jupyter-supported environment.
